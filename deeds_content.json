For instance, performing prayer solely for the pleasure of Allah will earn reward, but if done to impress others, it leads to sin. Even permissible daily activities like earning a livelihood, choosing a profession, or dressing well can be transformed into acts of worship when coupled with a good intention.\n\n(This is a sample detailed content fetched from the JSON file to verify the implementation.)"
