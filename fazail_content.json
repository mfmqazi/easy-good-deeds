      "content": "For nine years, since his selection by Allah for His mission, the Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) had been delivering the message of Allah in Mecca and making all efforts to guide and reform his community. Excepting a few persons who had either embraced Islam or who helped him though not accepting his creed, all the rest in Mecca left no stone unturned in persecuting and deriding him and his followers.\n\nThe Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam) left for Taif with the hope of winning them over to Islam, thus giving quarter to Muslims from the persecution of the Qureysh, and also establishing a base for the future propagation of Islam. \n\nInstead of accepting his message, they refused even to listen to him and treated him most contemptuously and rudely. They set the street urchins after him to hiss, to hoot, to jeer at, and to stone him. He was so much pelted at with stones that his whole body was covered with blood.\n\nWhen he was far out of the town, he prayed to Allah thus:\n\n\"O my Allah! To Thee I complain of the feebleness of my strength, of my lack of resources and my being unimportant in the eyes of people. O Most Merciful of all those capable of showing mercy! Thou art the Lord of the weak, and Thou art my own Lord.\"\n\nThe Heavens were moved by the prayer, and Jibrail (Alayhis salaam) appeared with an angel who offered to crush the town between the mountains. The merciful Prophet said:\n\n\"Even if these people do not accept Islam, I do hope from Allah that there will be persons from among their progeny who would worship Allah and serve His cause.\"\n\nBehold the conduct of our noble Prophet (Sallallaho alaihe wasallam)! We get so much irritated over a little trouble or a mere abuse from somebody, yet the Prophet showed such magnanimity.",

He very much regretted to have missed the honour of participating in the first and the most illustrious battle for Islam. He longed for a chance wherein he could make amends for Badr.\n\nHe did not have to wait for long. The battle of Uhud came about in the following year. He joined the army with the most determined zeal. When the battle took a turn and Muslims suffered a reverse, Hadhrat Anas saw Hadhrat Sa'ad bin Ma'az passing in front of him. He shouted to him:\n\n\"O Sa'ad! Where are you going? By Allah! I smell the fragrance of Paradise coming from Mount Uhud.\"\n\nSaying this, he threw himself into the very thick of the enemy, and fought tooth and nail till he met his martyrdom.\n\nAfter the battle, it was found that his body had been mauled and mutilated to such an extent that only his sister could identify him, and that barely from the finger tips. No less than eighty wounds of arrows and swords were counted on his body.\n\nThose who strive in the path of Allah with sincerity and devotion taste the pleasures of Paradise even in this world.",

He was an Abyssinian slave of a disbeliever in Mecca. His conversion to Islam was, naturally, not liked by his master and he was, therefore, persecuted mercilessly.\n\nUmayyah bin Khalaf, who was the worst enemy of Islam, would make him lie down on the burning sand at midday and would place a heavy stone on his breast, so that he could not even move a limb. He would then say to him:\n\n\"Renounce Islam or swelter and die.\"\n\nEven under these afflictions, Bilal (Radhiyallaho anho) would exclaim:\n\n\"Ahad - The One (Allah). Ahad - The One (Allah).\"\n\nHe was whipped at night and with the cuts thus received, made to lie on the burning ground during the day to make him either forsake Islam or to die a lingering death from wounds. The torturers would get tired and take turns (Abu Jahl, Umayyah and others) and vie with one another in afflicting more and more painful punishment, but Hadhrat Bilal would not yield.\n\nAt last Abu Bakr (Radhiyallaho anho) bought his freedom, and he became a free Muslim.",
